## Primary Sources

A lot of the etymologies of computer terms are listed incorrectly once, and then the error is propagated to everything that relies on that incorrect source. The best source is a primary source: a document that contains the first usage of a word (or, first usage of a word in a technology context).

Especially for modern technological terms, Etymonline, which doesn't list sources for its etymologies, has been found to have errors. Even the OED has an error (see "Surf"). However, for ancient etymologies, well-trusted dictionaries are probably ok.

When you're researching a word, keep checking the sources until you get to the actual usage, if possible!
