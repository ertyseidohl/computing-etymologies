> mid-15c., brousen, "feed on buds, eat leaves or twigs from" trees or bushes, from Old French broster "to sprout, bud," from brost "young shoot, twig, green food fit for cattle or deer," probably from Proto-Germanic \*brust- "bud, shoot," from PIE \*bhreus- "to swell, sprout" (see breast (n.)). It lost its -t in English perhaps on the mistaken notion that the letter was a past participle inflection. Figurative extension to "peruse" (books) is 1870s, American English. Related: Browsed; browsing.

Note: Would love a non-etymonline source.

## Cipher
> There are many theories about how the word "cipher" may have come to mean "encoding".

Note: The paper Ibrahim A. Al-Kadi's "Cryptography and Data Security: Cryptographic Properties of Arabic" may have more information, but I don't have access.

## Floppy

> To better distribute microprogram code, IBM developed the diskette drive in the late 1960s. In the 1970s, when this storage medium became widely used, marketers must have found the sober name “diskette” too bland, and so coined “floppy” to jazz it up.

## Electrician

Note: There may have been a time when an "electrician" was someone who performed stage tricks with electricity (levitating with static elec, etc). Need to investigate further. [Relevant Tweet by @pmg](https://mobile.twitter.com/pmg/status/1110289346534342656)

## Electricity

> The New Latin adjective _electricus_, originally meaning 'of amber', was first used to refer to amber's attractive properties by William Gilbert in his 1600 text De Magnete. The term came from the classical Latin _electrum_, amber, from the Greek ἤλεκτρον (elektron), amber.

## Hacker

Note: First recorded usage of "Hacker" in the tech sense was in 1963. See [this manybutfinite.com blog post](https://manybutfinite.com/post/first-recorded-usage-of-hacker/). Need to investigate further.

## Information

> The committee published an international standard vocabulary in 1966 (IFIP-ICC Vocabulary of Information Processing, North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam, 1968) that remains, with some modifications, an ISO/IEC standard (http:// www.iso.ch/cate/d7229.html). \[...\] 
In their original form, these definitions read as follows:
> * **Data.** A representation of facts or ideas in a formalized manner capable of being communicated or manipulated by some process.
> * **Information.** In automatic data processing the meaning that a human assigns to data by means of the known conventions used in its representation.
> These two clear and distinctive definitions conform reasonably with traditional usage. Contrast them with the corresponding definitions from The New International Webster’s Pocket Computer Dictionary of the English Language (Trident Press International, Naples, Fla., 1998, ISBN 1-888777-54-0):
> * **Data.** (sing. datum) Information, as that processed by a computer.
> * **Information.** Any data that can be stored, retrieved, and manipulated by a computer.
> These latter definitions are even murkier than the book’s title. Completely confused, they conflict with the words’ traditional usage. Although the worse dictionaries typically maul these definitions, the better dictionaries treat them almost as roughly.

## Sort

> The computing profession, for instance, uses the verb to sort to mean to order or to sequence. The dictionary defines sort as “to arrange according to sort, kind, or class”—a meaning too useful to lose, surely. This distortion has an historical foundation, however: When data processors kept data on punched cards, they used repetitive sorting—in the true sense of the word—to put a card file in any desired  sequence. Thus, sequencing on a fivedigit ID number would take five passes of the card file through a sorter, moving from low-order digit to high-order digit. Unfortunately, when magnetic tape replaced punched cards, the term “sorting” assumed the meaning “sequencing,” even though the process no longer involved sorting, but rather progressive merging of subsequences. When using four tape drives, a tape “sort” would typically halve the number of subsequences with each merge pass, then stop when it arrived at a single sequence.

## Technology

> The word _technology_, which joined the Greek root, _techne_ (an art or craft) with the suffix _ology_ (a branch of learning), first entered the English language in the seventeenth century. At that time, in keeping with its etymology, a _technology_ was a branch of learning, or discourse, or treatise concerned with the mechanic arts. As Eric Schatzberg has demonstrated in a seminal essay, the word then referred to a field of study, not an object of study. But the word, even in that now archaic sense, was a rarity in nineteenth-century America. By 1861, to be sure, it was accorded a somewhat greater prominence by the founders of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but they also were invoking the limited sense of the term to mean higher technical education. As for technology in the now familiar sense of the word — the mechanic arts collectively — it did not catch on in America until around 1900, when a few influential writers, notably Thorstein Veblen and Charles Beard, responding to German usage in the social sciences, accorded technology a pivotal role in shaping modern industrial society. But even then, the use of the word remained largely confined to academic and intellectual circles; it did not gain truly popular currency until the 1930s.
