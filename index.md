# Computing Etymologies

## Cipher (Encryption)
> There are many theories about how the word "cipher" may have come to mean "encoding".

Note: There appears to be a paper, Ibrahim A. Al-Kadi's "Cryptography and Data Security: Cryptographic Properties of Arabic" which dives into some of this etymology, however, I have been unable to locate a copy.


## Technology

> The word _technology_, which joined the Greek root, _techne_ (an art or craft) with the suffix _ology_ (a branch of learning), first entered the English language in the seventeenth century. At that time, in keeping with its etymology, a _technology_ was a branch of learning, or discourse, or treatise concerned with the mechanic arts. As Eric Schatzberg has demonstrated in a seminal essay, the word then referred to a field of study, not an object of study. But the word, even in that now archaic sense, was a rarity in nineteenth-century America. By 1861, to be sure, it was accorded a somewhat greater prominence by the founders of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but they also were invoking the limited sense of the term to mean higher technical education. As for technology in the now familiar sense of the word — the mechanic arts collectively — it did not catch on in America until around 1900, when a few influential writers, notably Thorstein Veblen and Charles Beard, responding to German usage in the social sciences, accorded technology a pivotal role in shaping modern industrial society. But even then, the use of the word remained largely confined to academic and intellectual circles; it did not gain truly popular currency until the 1930s.
