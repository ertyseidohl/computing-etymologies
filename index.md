# Computing Etymologies

## Cipher
> There are many theories about how the word "cipher" may have come to mean "encoding".

## Information

> The committee published an international standard vocabulary in 1966 (IFIP-ICC Vocabulary of Information Processing, North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam, 1968) that remains, with some modifications, an ISO/IEC standard (http:// www.iso.ch/cate/d7229.html). \[...\] 
In their original form, these definitions read as follows:
> * **Data.** A representation of facts or ideas in a formalized manner capable of being communicated or manipulated by some process.
> * **Information.** In automatic data processing the meaning that a human assigns to data by means of the known conventions used in its representation.
> These two clear and distinctive definitions conform reasonably with traditional usage. Contrast them with the corresponding definitions from The New International Webster’s Pocket Computer Dictionary of the English Language (Trident Press International, Naples, Fla., 1998, ISBN 1-888777-54-0):
> * **Data.** (sing. datum) Information, as that processed by a computer.
> * **Information.** Any data that can be stored, retrieved, and manipulated by a computer.
> These latter definitions are even murkier than the book’s title. Completely confused, they conflict with the words’ traditional usage. Although the worse dictionaries typically maul these definitions, the better dictionaries treat them almost as roughly.

## Sort

> The computing profession, for instance, uses the verb to sort to mean to order or to sequence. The dictionary defines sort as “to arrange according to sort, kind, or class”—a meaning too useful to lose, surely. This distortion has an historical foundation, however: When data processors kept data on punched cards, they used repetitive sorting—in the true sense of the word—to put a card file in any desired  sequence. Thus, sequencing on a fivedigit ID number would take five passes of the card file through a sorter, moving from low-order digit to high-order digit. Unfortunately, when magnetic tape replaced punched cards, the term “sorting” assumed the meaning “sequencing,” even though the process no longer involved sorting, but rather progressive merging of subsequences. When using four tape drives, a tape “sort” would typically halve the number of subsequences with each merge pass, then stop when it arrived at a single sequence.

## Technology

> The word _technology_, which joined the Greek root, _techne_ (an art or craft) with the suffix _ology_ (a branch of learning), first entered the English language in the seventeenth century. At that time, in keeping with its etymology, a _technology_ was a branch of learning, or discourse, or treatise concerned with the mechanic arts. As Eric Schatzberg has demonstrated in a seminal essay, the word then referred to a field of study, not an object of study. But the word, even in that now archaic sense, was a rarity in nineteenth-century America. By 1861, to be sure, it was accorded a somewhat greater prominence by the founders of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but they also were invoking the limited sense of the term to mean higher technical education. As for technology in the now familiar sense of the word — the mechanic arts collectively — it did not catch on in America until around 1900, when a few influential writers, notably Thorstein Veblen and Charles Beard, responding to German usage in the social sciences, accorded technology a pivotal role in shaping modern industrial society. But even then, the use of the word remained largely confined to academic and intellectual circles; it did not gain truly popular currency until the 1930s.
