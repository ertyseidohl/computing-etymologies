# Computing Etymologies

## Cipher (Encryption)
> There are many theories about how the word "cipher" may have come to mean "encoding".

Source: [Wikipedia: Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher#Etymology)

Note: There appears to be a paper, Ibrahim A. Al-Kadi's "Cryptography and Data Security: Cryptographic Properties of Arabic" which dives into some of this etymology, however, I have been unable to locate a copy.
